# ShadowNetwatch
Advanced criminal network intelligence tool leveraging graph theory, behavioral signatures, and real-time anomaly detection to expose covert relationships, hidden actors, and organized crime patterns. Designed for law enforcement, threat analysts, and data-driven justice systems.

---

## Overview

Illicit networks often operate in the shadows, exploiting complex human relationships and communication patterns to evade detection. ShadowNetwatch provides a systematic approach to disrupt these operations by transforming fragmented data into actionable intelligence.

---

## Key Features

* **Graph-based Network Mapping**
  Extracts entities and relationships into dynamic visual graphs using centrality measures and clustering algorithms.

* **Behavioral Signature Profiling**
  Identifies anomalous behavior patterns through temporal and relational analytics.

* **Modular Inference Engine**
  Infers hidden links and latent actors using probabilistic logic and data augmentation.

* **Real-Time Threat Feed Integration**
  Supports streaming data to reflect live updates from intelligence sources or active investigations.

* **Custom Risk Scoring Framework**
  Quantifies risk levels across nodes and edges based on behavioral weights and contextual signals.

## Technologies Used

```
* Python (NetworkX, Scikit-learn, Pandas)
* Neo4j (Graph Database)
* Streamlit / Dash (Optional Visualization)
* Kafka or WebSocket (for Real-Time Streams)
* JSON / CSV data ingestion pipeline
```
